    <h2>About the course</h2>
    <p>
      Learn to code on our 24-week on-site course, which largely focusses on JavaScript. Students will learn to build responsive websites, smartphone applications for Android and iOS, and voice applications for Amazon's Alexa.
    </p>
    <p>
      The course is beginner friendly (no prior coding knowledge is required) and provides students with valuable skills in software engineering, allowing them to go on to get careers in the tech industry, or to startup their own ventures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Students will learn best practices that will make them valuable to employers. These include Test-Driven Development, Agile methodologies, Object-Oriented Programming and writing clean maintainable code. They will also be given a solid grounding in the various tools used within the industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Classes run twice a week from 18:30 to 21:30. Students are also expected to study remotely for an additional 14 hours per week. Outside of classes, remote support is available via the MCRcodes Slack channel where students can ask tutors and other students for help.
